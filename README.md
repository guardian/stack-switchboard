## To run locally

You'll need to spin up both `app` and `frontend` in separate terminals, which handle the API and React client respectively.

```bash
$ cd app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```


## To Deploy

Continuous deployment with TeamCity & Riffraff should be set up. Head there to build and deploy the app.
